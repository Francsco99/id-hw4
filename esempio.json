The US-related bursts show the opposite pattern: the amplitude is initially dependent on the reward magnitude, but is progressively decreases to a value close to the VTA baseline. One can observe that the cancelation is not total, the maximal value of US-related bursts being between 0.3 and 0.4, while the baseline activity is 0.2. However, the duration of the phasic is also reduced from approximately 200 ms for unpredicted rewards to 50 ms for fully predicted rewards, so the total amount of dopamine released can be considered relatively low. This aspect will be discussed in section 4.2.</p>",

              "<p>Panel <bold>(B)</bold>, corresponding to a reward magnitude of 0.5, shows a different behavior. While the CS-related burst still increases to reach a maximum equal to the initial US-related burst (although more slowly), the cancelation of the US is both slower and not total. This suggests that reward magnitude influences conditioned responses in VTA in a non-linear manner. This will be further investigated in the following section. Altogether, the results show that the cancelation of the US-related VTA activation happens well after the appearance of CS-related bursts, what is consistent with the experimental data (Pan et al., <xref rid=\"B121\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2005</xref>).</p>",
