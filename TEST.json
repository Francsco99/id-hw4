    "title": "The planetary biology of cytochrome P450 aromatases",
    "abstract": "<sec xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><title>Background</title><p>Joining a model for the molecular evolution of a protein family to the paleontological and geological records (geobiology), and then to the chemical structures of substrates, products, and protein folds, is emerging as a broad strategy for generating hypotheses concerning function in a post-genomic world. This strategy expands systems biology to a planetary context, necessary for a notion of fitness to underlie (as it must) any discussion of function within a biomolecular system.</p></sec><sec xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><title>Results</title><p>Here, we report an example of such an expansion, where tools from planetary biology were used to analyze three genes from the pig <italic>Sus scrofa </italic>that encode cytochrome P450 aromatases\u2013enzymes that convert androgens into estrogens. The evolutionary history of the vertebrate aromatase gene family was reconstructed. Transition redundant exchange silent substitution metrics were used to interpolate dates for the divergence of family members, the paleontological record was consulted to identify changes in physiology that correlated in time with the change in molecular behavior, and new aromatase sequences from peccary were obtained. Metrics that detect changing function in proteins were then applied, including K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S </sub>values and those that exploit structural biology. These identified specific amino acid replacements that were associated with changing substrate and product specificity during the time of presumed adaptive change. The combined analysis suggests that aromatase paralogs arose in pigs as a result of selection for Suoidea with larger litters than their ancestors, and permitted the Suoidea to survive the global climatic trauma that began in the Eocene.</p></sec><sec xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This combination of bioinformatics analysis, molecular evolution, paleontology, cladistics, global climatology, structural biology, and organic chemistry serves as a paradigm in planetary biology. As the geological, paleontological, and genomic records improve, this approach should become widely useful to make systems biology statements about high-level function for biomolecular systems.</p></sec>",

              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Other data suggest that small litters are in fact the primitive artiodactyl condition. Tragulids (mouse deer or chevrotains) are surviving small, primitive ruminants that are not too dissimilar from <italic>Diacodexis </italic>in body form, but only have one-two young per litter. Additionally, fossil record data on pregnant oreodonts (an extinct group probably related to the ruminant/camelid artiodactyl lineage, but with a suoid-like plesiomorphic postcranial morphology) shows that they also only had one-two young [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A cladogram of the Artiodactyla (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>) illustrates the probable acquisition of multiparous versus uniparous reproductive strategies, and places the character of litters with typically more than two members emerging just before the divergence of Tayassuidae and Suidae.</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">It goes without saying that still more factors might be associated with an increase in litter size from one-two (presumed in <italic>Diacodexis</italic>, see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>) to 12 or more in domestic swine. Most trivially, this increase might be associated with an increase in ovulation rate, and/or an adjustment in the structures and binding specificities of estrogen receptors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>].</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Nevertheless, the first aromatase duplication, shared by pigs and peccaries, appears to have happened in the late Eocene (recognizing the error associated with these dates), around 35 Ma (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>). This was a time of great global change, with dramatic cooling in the higher latitudes. More archaic kinds of mammals (e.g., some earlier families of perissodactyls and artiodactyls) became extinct, while many modern families (including the Suidae and Tayassuidae) became established at this time [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. Suoids differed from other contemporaneous ungulates in their commitment to omnivory, even though a few forms, such as the modern warthog <italic>Phacochoerus aethiopicus</italic>, are more specialized herbivores. Perhaps the ability to bear a slightly larger litter than other artiodactyls was advantageous to them in this time of global ecological transition. However, it should be noted that larger litters usually mean altricial (i.e., relatively underdeveloped) young, a reproductive strategy apparently not available to larger, cursorial (running-adapted) ungulates, which give birth to precocial (i.e., well developed) young that are fully locomotory at birth [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>].</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">The second aromatase duplication, with the ensuing capacity to produce multiple young, probably occurred within the family Suidae, some time during the Oligocene. The molecular data suggest dates of divergence between porcine fetal and placental aromatases as between 27\u201338 Ma, and the earliest known suid is of early Oligocene age [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>], around 33 Ma (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref>). Large litters may have characterized the entire suid family. While the extant subfamily Suinae is primarily a Plio-Pleistocene radiation, during the Oligocene to Pliocene suids were exceedingly diverse taxonomically (with six other subfamilies known) as well as individually abundant as fossils [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In contrast, the predominantly North American tayassuids were never as diverse. It is possible that this tremendous Old-World diversity of suids, which continues to this day, is related to their capacity for the production of large litters.</p>"

              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A complete maximum likelihood analysis of the aromatase gene family was performed using the PAUP and PAML programs. The resulting tree, generated in PAUP, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref>, with parameters estimated using PAML. Once more, the generation of paralogs in the pig was found to have occurred after the divergence of pigs from oxen. A high K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S </sub>value (0.93) was again found in the divergence of the swine isoforms on the branch leading to the ancestor of the placental and embryonic enzymes following their divergence from the pig ovarian enzyme. The distribution of substitutions along this branch is consistent with altered functional constraints for the placental and embryonic enzymes compared with their extinct and extant counterparts (Tables <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>].</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">We correlated the episode of rapid sequence change during the emergence of the embryonic and placental paralogs with the structural biology of aromatase. A homology model of aromatase was built from progesterone 21-hydroxylase from rabbit liver (coordinates from PDB file 1DT6) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>], a homologous cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase. Residues undergoing replacement during the episodes represented by branches in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref> (branches 1\u20133) are highlighted in color on the 3D model using a program in prototype with HyperChem (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>).</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Multiple features within the pattern of amino acid replacement were apparent. First, the sites accepting amino acid replacements in the branches with low K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S </sub>values (as represented by branch 2 in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref>) were typically scattered without any obvious pattern over the surface of the protein. This is expected for neutral drift, although an adaptive role for these replacements is not excluded by this analysis.</p>",
              "<p xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Further, this hypothesis generation itself generates discoveries that might lead to their own hypotheses. An analysis of the evolutionary branches separating pigs and humans suggests an additional episode of adaptive change. The branch leading to the ancestor of human aromatase (branch 3) has a remarkably high K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S </sub>ratio (13 non-synonymous and no synonymous changes; Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref>). This <italic>is </italic>a K<sub>A</sub>/K<sub>S </sub>ratio greater than unity, and does (pending evaluation of its statistical significance) compel the inference of an episode of adaptive change. Intriguingly, these changes are also clustered in the same regions of the structure as those changing along branch 1 leading to the stem fetal/placental enzyme, near the substrate and co-reductant binding sites. This implies that the substrate/product specificity of the ancestral aromatase protein was not like that of either the human or the pig placental forms, but rather reflects features that arose convergently in these two species [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>].</p>"
